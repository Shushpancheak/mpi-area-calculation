The following code performs a calculation of an area underneath the function $f(x) = \frac{4}{1 + x^2}$ from 0 to 1 by various means.

## Structure.
The source code may be found in `main.cpp` file. The resulting plots are depicted in the `plots.pdf`.

## How to run.
To run the code on the remote host supporting `Slurm`, you should just type

```bash
